# Asteroids-Orbit-classifier-using-ML
This paper used machine learning to classify asteroids from the Orbit Dataset for All Known Asteroids into their orbit type. Supervised learning was used to make the classification. Multiple machine learning models were built: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Multi-layer Perceptron, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, and Random Forest. Multi-layer Perceptron performed the best with 100% accuracy. The worst-performing algorithm was the K-Nearest Neighborwith 83% accuracy.
